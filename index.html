						<p>Dr. Ganesh Neelakanta Iyer currently works as a faculty at National University of Singapore (NUS) in the Department of Computer Science. 
							Prior to this, he worked in the DevOps team at Salesforce, Hyderabad and served as an Associate Professor in the Department of
							Computer Science & Engineering, School of Engineering, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham,
							Coimbatore. He has received his Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering
							(University first rank) from Mahatma Gandhi University, Kerala, India in 2004 and Masters
							and PhD degrees from National University of Singapore in 2008 and 2012 respectively. He
							brings in a decade of industry experience in various companies including Sasken
							Communication Technologies, NXP semiconductors and most recently at Progress software. He
							has handled several roles in the software industry including QA Architect, Technical Support
							Manager, Engineering development and Technology Evangelist.</p>
						<p> He is a strong advocate of Agile Software Engineering and believes in developing software products in an agile way. With his industry experience
							in working on large scale enterprise software products and handling different agile roles such as Scrum Master and Priduct Owner, he is now 
							imparting those software engineering knowledge to students at NUS. 
						</p>
						<p> He has strong inclination towards Game Theory. He applies game theory for handling conflicts, enforcing 
							cooperation and for multi-agent systems. His technical knowledge and experience are in various areas 
							including Cloud/Edge/Fog Computing Paradigms (including cloud platforms, Node.js and containers), 
							Computer Networks, Software Engineering practices (Agile) and Quality Analysis, Economic models 
							(Game Theoretic principles) and current day practices on cloud-based enterprise architectures, 
							Internet of Things (IoT) based systems, Machine Learning and technology for traditional Indian dance 
							(such as Kathakali) popularization. His mathematical interests includegame theory, graph theory, 
							optimization principles etc. Over the past several years he has acquired practical knowledge and 
							experience in various cutting-edge software engineering methodologies including Agile framework 
							and has experience formulating and implementing various software engineering principles using Agile 
							for large and small product development teams.</p>
						<p> Dr. Iyer is active in doing practical industry-oriented research on the above topics of his interest. 
							He also aspire to do research on technological innovations to popularize traditional classical arts 
							such as Kathakali and Koodiyattam.</p>

							addition to several book chapters, journals and conference publications. Dr. Iyer has delivered several 
							practical workshops and talks on various cutting-edge technology topics in many academic and 
							industry events in several countries including USA, Europe, Australia and Asia. Many of these 
							were on the contributions made by him in his industry engagement for software quality analysis 
							with current day software engineering principles such as Agile for application development 
							involving cloud platforms, mobile platforms and IoT based systems.</p>
						<p> Dr. Iyer is an IEEE and IEEE-CS Member. He has been a reviewer of many internationals Journals including 
							IEEE Transactions on Computers, IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems and several 
							international conferences. He was also the program chair for several international conferences 
							including ICCCI and ICIWE.</p>
						<p>Dr. Iyer has strong teaching skills and boundless passion for teaching. He was a visiting faculty at 
							IIIT-H (International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad), and has been teaching 
							various subjects including “Game Theory for Computer Science", “Computer Networks”, 
							“Advanced Computer Networks” and “Scripting and Computer environments” for which, he has 
							framed the syllabus, developed the materials and references, structured the grading scheme 
							and formulated continuous assessment strategies. Further, he was a member of Board of Studies at 
							JNTU-H (a premium university in India) where he participates in framing the syllabus for the 
							university’s upcoming academic year. </p>
						<p>He is also an expert in performing Kathakali, a traditional Indian dance. He has composed a story in 
							Kathakali and he spends a considerable amount of his personal time to uplift this traditional art
